# Spring Boot Microservices Application

This repository contains a Spring Boot Microservices Application written in Java. The application is designed to demonstrate the development and deployment of microservices architecture using Spring Boot, a popular Java framework for building production-grade applications.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: The application is structured into multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific domain or functionality.
- **Spring Boot**: Utilizes the Spring Boot framework for rapid development and easy deployment.
- **RESTful APIs**: Communicate between microservices via RESTful APIs, adhering to best practices.
- **Service Discovery**: Implements service discovery and registration using tools like Eureka or Consul.
- **Containerization**: Docker containers are used to package each microservice, ensuring consistency across different environments.
- **Orchestration**: Optionally, Kubernetes or Docker Compose can be used for orchestrating and managing the containers.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrates logging frameworks like Log4j or Logback for centralized logging. Monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana can be integrated for performance monitoring.
- **Security**: Implements security measures like JWT authentication and authorization for securing microservices.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes various databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc., depending on the specific requirements of each microservice.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Utilizes messaging systems like Kafka or RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication between microservices.

## Installation

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
2. **Build Microservices**: Navigate into each microservice directory and build them using Maven or Gradle.


3. **Run Microservices**: Run each microservice individually. Ensure that any dependencies like databases or messaging systems are running as well.

4. **(Optional) Containerization**: If using Docker, build Docker images for each microservice and run them in Docker containers.

5. **(Optional) Orchestration**: If using Kubernetes or Docker Compose, deploy the Docker containers to the respective orchestration platform.

## Usage

Once the microservices are up and running, you can interact with them using their respective RESTful APIs. Use tools like Postman or curl to make HTTP requests to the endpoints exposed by each microservice.
